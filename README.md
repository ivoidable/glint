# Glint

## What is glint?

Glint is a reliable, fast, and open-source chat app I built for me and my friends.
it will also implement the Commander game I built for us, so essentially its 2 projects in 1.

## Tech stack

I will build it with dioxus in rust as a front-end, with firebase for a serverless architecture.

## Release date

I am still not sure about releasing to the public, but the project is set to be done by Septemper 2024
